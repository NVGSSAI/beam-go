# beam-go
## Go to your Documents/44-517 folder. We want to create a new project folder under 44-517. 
## Make new directory beam-go (no spaces - for the easiest life, never leave spaces in folder/file names!)
## Change directory into beam-go. This will be our root project folder for the quick start.
## In your folder, run go mod init github.com/NVGSSAI/beam-go (use your github profile name)
## Use code . to open VS Code here.
## Create the sample hello.go file in your new modules. Customize it. We'll be able to import your hello app from GitHub.
## When done, use go run . to execute the default file in the folder.
